#This is really bad code
#My bad virus game shop
#If there is a ! at the beginning of a variable, it's likely it's a variable you already have, but in a different name
#PLS HELP WRITING THE FUNCTIONS/COMMANDS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE MOST OF THEM
#I USED SOME VARIABLES THAT I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS USED
#IF YOU HAVE THE TIME, PLEASE CHECK EACH LINE!!!
#Thanks guys, couldn't have asked for a better team ;)
